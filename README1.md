# TODO Application (CLI) - A C++ Task Manager

**Project for [Aapke Course ka Naam, e.g., Data Structures]**

---

## 1. Description
This is a lightweight, simple, and efficient console-based (CLI) TODO Application. It allows users to dynamically add, view, complete, and delete tasks at runtime.

The core of this project is the implementation and practical use of a **Singly Linked List (SLL)** data structure, built from scratch in C++.

## 3. Language
* **C++**

## 4. Key Features
* Add new tasks to the list.
* View all pending and completed tasks.
* Mark specific tasks as "Complete".
* Delete tasks from the list.

## 5. Data Structure
This project is built using a **Singly Linked List (SLL)** to manage the tasks. This choice was made because:
* **Dynamic Size:** The list can grow or shrink as needed, unlike a static array.
* **Efficient Operations:** Deletion and insertion are efficient, as they only require pointer manipulation, not shifting of elements.
